## What are Account Owned Tokens?

Account Owned Tokens are a first step that Cloudflare is taking in order to represent service principals in our service, and they are being released currently as an Open Beta.
Engineers across the company are working to ensure that all features eventually become compatible with Account Owned Tokens, and we have provided a short compatability list below.
If you are working with a service that is not currently supported by account owned tokens please continue to use the existing user tokens.
User tokens will continue to work, and we do not have plans to deprecate them.

Account Owned Tokens will be visible for Super Administrators of accounts on the Cloudflare dashboard via **Manage Account** > **API Tokens**.
The existing token creation UI is available, and can also be accessed from the API at /accounts/:accountID/tokens

Try using Account Owned Tokens specifically in these scenarios:

1. You require business continuity when managing tokens as a team of super administrators
2. You need to restrict API access on your account, and want to centralize visibility and management of these tokens
